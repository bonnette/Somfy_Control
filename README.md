The Adafruit ESP8266 (Hazzah) board displays a set of buttons in a web page.

The page controls the Hazzah's onboard LED for testing purposes as well as the shade Up/Down.<br/>
The Hazzah web page can be accessed on the internet using port forwarding on your local network.<br/><br/>

Added new stl files to the 3Dprinter file folder.<br/>
These parts are beefier and more in alignment than the old parts.
